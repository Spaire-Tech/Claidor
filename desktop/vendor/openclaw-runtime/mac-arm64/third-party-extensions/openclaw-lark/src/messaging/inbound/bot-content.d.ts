 * Reply-routing decisions for the Feishu dispatch path.
 *
 * In bot-to-bot group scenarios, Feishu will pull thread-style replies into
 * a hidden "topic view" that group members cannot see (#32980). The peer bot
 * keeps receiving messages but humans in the chat see nothing — a silent
 * failure mode that turns bot↔bot chat into a black hole.
 *
 * This module centralizes the three signals that decide where a reply lands:
 *   1. isGroup            — DMs never have the topic-view trap
 *   2. senderIsBot        — only bot→bot triggers it
 *   3. dc.isThread        — inbound was a thread reply (also inferred from
 *                            root_id in topic groups when threadSession=true)
 *
 * Output: a routing object consumed by every outbound call site (main
 * dispatcher + i18n command card + i18n command text fallback), so the
 * three call sites never drift out of sync again.

 *
 * Deliberately INDEPENDENT of `suppressForBotPeer` (which only governs
 * thread-vs-main routing): the addressee must be resolvable even on a
 * human-orchestrated kickoff, where the triggering sender is a person but the
 * conversation is meant to continue between bots.
 *
 *   1. Bot sender  → @ the sender back, continuing the exchange.
 *   2. Otherwise (e.g. a human kicking off a bot debate) → if the inbound
 *      message @-mentions exactly ONE party other than ourselves, treat that
 *      party as the designated peer. Zero / multiple non-self mentions are
 *      ambiguous, so we add no forced @ (avoids spamming unrelated members).
 *
 * Group-only: bot-at-bot @ delivery semantics don't apply to DMs.

/**
 * Resolve reply routing for the current dispatch, performing two tasks:
 *
 *  1. **Topic-group thread inference (may mutate `dc`).** In topic groups
 *     (chat_mode=topic), reply events may carry `root_id` without
 *     `thread_id`. When `threadSession` is enabled and the chat is
 *     thread-capable, treat `root_id` as a synthetic `threadId` so replies
 *     stay inside the topic instead of creating a new top-level message.
 *     This step mutates `dc.isThread` and `dc.ctx.threadId` so subsequent
 *     code (session-key resolution, sentinel scoping, history scoping)
 *     observes the same routing decision.
 *
 *  2. **Reply routing decision (pure).** Computes `replyInThread` and
 *     `suppressForBotPeer` from the post-inference state. In bot→bot group
 *     chats `replyInThread` is forced to `false` regardless of the inbound
 *     shape, preventing the topic-view trap.
