 * Cross-bot loop guard for bot-at-bot (ping-pong) conversations.
 *
 * Background: when two different bots @-mention each other in a group, each
 * reply wakes the other, which replies again — an endless debate. The
 * existing self-echo filter only drops a bot's *own* echo; it does nothing
 * for A↔B loops. This module adds a deterministic hard brake: count the
 * consecutive turns whose sender is a bot per (chat, thread), and stop
 * auto-replying once the count exceeds a cap. Any human turn resets the
 * counter, so a new human-driven exchange starts fresh.
 *
 * State is process-local and best-effort (each bot process keeps its own
 * counter for the peer's messages it receives). Idle conversations decay so
 * a long-quiet chat doesn't carry a stale count into a new exchange.
