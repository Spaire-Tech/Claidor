# Prism — the Watch (Track C)

Lane log. Charter: `docs/pierce/lanes.md`; plan: `docs/pierce/swens-plan.md`
Track C, as amended 24 August 2026. I own `server/polar/tieout/watch/`,
`server/tests/tieout/test_watch*`, `server/scripts/watch_*`, and this
file. The engine is a read-only library to me;
`polar.tieout.audit._shape(cell, anchoring=True)` is a frozen
interface I align on and never change.

## 25 August 2026 — lane opened

**The branch.** The session was created from
`claude/prism-watch-alignment-ftfjx3`, whose tip is a merge commit of
an older state of `claude/pierce-phase-6-writing-mjkaj6` and carries
nothing of its own. `lanes.md` says lane branches are based on
`claude/pierce-phase-6-writing-mjkaj6`'s tip, and everything this
lane's first task depends on — `scripts/corpus_au_uk.py`, `notes.md`,
`lanes.md`, the A7-normalized shape hash — exists only there. So
`swens/prism` is based on that tip (`265bfeb`), and the deviation
from the prompt's literal « this branch's tip » is named here rather
than made silently.

**The corpus.** `uv run python -m scripts.corpus_au_uk` fetched all
27 files (the eleven ED2 versions among them) into
`server/scripts/corpus_au_uk/`, git-ignored, matching the manifest's
expected count. Nothing committed, per the corpus rule.

## C1 registration — the raw version diff, hand-checked (REGISTERED BEFORE RESULTS)

Committed before the differ under test has produced any number on
the pair. The rules below are fixed; if they prove wrong the change
is recorded here with a reason, never made silently.

**The pair.** `ofgem_ed2/v2_2023-07-14.xlsx` (old) →
`ofgem_ed2/v2_2023-07-31.xlsx` (new). Chosen on the manifest's
metadata alone — the two closest-dated adjacent versions, seventeen
days apart, same major version — before reading either file. If the
diff turns out enormous the pair still stands; only the eyes-on
sample sizes below are per-cell, so the check stays feasible at any
diff size.

**What C1 diffs.** The raw stored grid, not the engine's labelled
cell universe: every cell either file stores, compared on two axes —
*content* (the formula text, or the typed literal where there is no
formula) and *cached value* (what Excel last computed, exactly as
stored; no tolerance — a tolerance is an opinion, and the raw diff
has none). Kinds: `added`, `removed`, `changed` (with
formula-changed / value-changed flags, both allowed at once), plus
sheets added/removed. The raw diff is deliberately blind to row
shifts — one inserted row will read as hundreds of changed cells.
That blindness is C1's honest contract; repairing it is C2's job.

**The instrument.** Two independent readers of the same files:

1. The differ under test — `polar.tieout.watch` reading through
   `openpyxl` (the watch package's own read path; the engine is not
   touched).
2. The hand-check instrument — `server/scripts/watch_handcheck.py`,
   committed with this registration: Python **stdlib only**
   (`zipfile`, `xml.etree`, `re`), reading sheet XML, shared
   strings, and the workbook part directly. It shares no parsing
   code with the differ or with `openpyxl`.

**The check, in order.**

1. Both instruments produce, for the pair, the full set of
   (ref → status) over the union of populated cells:
   added / removed / formula-changed / value-changed / unchanged.
2. The two sets are compared **completely** — every ref, both
   directions. Every disagreement is adjudicated by me reading the
   raw XML of that cell in both files and writing the verdict here.
   A differ defect is fixed and the *whole* comparison re-run from
   scratch; an instrument defect likewise.
3. Because two instruments can be wrong the same way only through
   the file itself, a seeded sample is then read eyes-on in raw
   XML: 20 cells the instruments agree are changed, 10 agreed
   added-or-removed (or as many as exist, if fewer), 10 agreed
   unchanged, drawn with `random.Random(20260825)` from the sorted
   ref lists. Any eyes-on disagreement is a full stop and a re-run.
4. C1 passes when steps 2 and 3 close with zero unresolved
   disagreements. The verdict, the counts, and every adjudication
   land in this log.

**Exclusions, stated now.** The instruments compare worksheet cell
storage: defined names, VBA, charts, formats/styles, comments, and
data-validation are out of C1's scope (the Watch's later steps and
other lanes own those). Cached-value comparison is on the stored
lexical value (numbers compared as decimal text, not as re-parsed
floats, so no round-trip opinion enters). A formula stored with a
cached error value is compared like any other stored text.
